				"The rarest and most expensive to craft of all golems, the adamantine golem is used as a guard for priceless artifacts. Due to it's immunity to most magics the golem serves as a great defense against arcane and weaponry alike. Truly a behemoth of size and power to face an adamantine golem is to face an unmoving wall and unstoppable weapon in one outstanding force. While the adamantine golem doesn't contain any of the magical powers of other golems the sheer strength and brute force the golem possesses poses just as great of a threat."
